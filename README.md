# Young_CSCI2270_FinalProject

My project is going to be a "Local Note Storing Program"

This program will be used for storing and saving messages, this program in emulate a E-Mail
web service although things will be stored using txt files.

Data Types Used
I plan to use a Hash table, with each index as an Red Black Tree, and then each red and black
tree will have linked lists running off the names which will store messages and data.

On exit, data will be stored in seperate text file which will be opened with the program is
opened.


DATA IS OUTDATED AND NOT FUNCTIONAL,

Finished Data will be Uploaded when I get to my files on my home Desktop.
