# Local Mail Server

My project is going to be a "Local Note Storing Program"

This program will be used for storing and saving messages, this program in emulate a E-Mail
web service.

Data Types Used
I plan to use a Hash table, with each index as an Linked List. You will be able to log in and send mail, and log out.
On exit, All data will be lost.

How to Run:
Download Respitory files, dependencies should be loaded when Young_Jimmy_FinalProject.cbp is ran.
If not here is a list of dependencies

MailStorage.cpp
MailStorage.here

The File will run off the Main.cpp file, and will open a normal command prompt main menu.
Create multiple Accounts to send mail through the program's Local Mail Server.

Future Features:

I am working on having the program Save all the Data into a JSON format, and then print it out
to an XML file, which will be read in when the program Starts, so when you close the program data 
will not be lost.

The Dependencies used are filed:
iostream
vector
stdlib.h

System Requirements:
Any Standard Operating Systems with a c++ compiler. 
ie:
NetBeans
CodeBlocks
eclipse
